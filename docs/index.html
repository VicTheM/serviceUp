            <h2>About</h2>
            <p id="about-paragraph">This site was built as a Capstone project for ALX Software Engineering course. It was inspired by my lack of getting clients consistently (I am an Electrician by profession)
                and the need to have a platform where I can be easily found by clients. I decided to build a platform where professionals can be easily found by clients.<br>
                I sat and saw other electrician coe from a very far place to work for people in my area, and I wondered, "How can they bypass me whe I am closer?" so proximity, authenticity
                and availability are the three factors that determine which professional is assigned to a client.
            </p>

                <h3>How it was built</h3>
                <p>
                    Amazingly, it was built in 3 weeks. I used Flask for the backend, and pure HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend.
                    This current landing page is being hosted on giuthub pages, and the button above that says "Goto site" will take you to the actual site.
                    The main backend is hosted on an ubuntu machine, and served via gunicorn which gets proxy request from an Nginx web server.
